# Test Jig
This app is for replaying captured requests against a music cast speaker.

`ActivityLogMiddleware.cs` in the server project logs the requests between the MusicCast App and the Swimbait Server.

This app can then replay those calls to a real MusicCast speaker for logging of the responses.
